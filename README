DeckConverter
=============

This is a software to convert YGOPro percy deck to Markdown.
This is a work in progress and I'm still a student so if I make mistakes feel
free to correct them to help me.

I haven't added a licence yet since it's a small project but I plan on using
the GPL3 licence.

GTK is needed to run the software, I haven't tested on another computer yet.

It works on Debian Jessie, juste use `python3 DeckConverter.py` in the right
directory to run the software.
